# PythonCoding_Problem_Solving4_Life_in_weeks
Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.  https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/05/life-weeks.html  Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old. f-Strings coding example: name = 'Tushar' ; age = 23 ;
print(f"Hello, My name is {name} and I'm {age} years old.")

age = input("What is your current age?")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# 1 yr is 365 days; 1 yr is 52 weeks; 1 yr is 12 months

age_as_int = int(age)

year_to_days = (90 - age_as_int)  * 365

year_to_weeks = (90 - age_as_int) * 52

year_to_months = (90 - age_as_int) * 12

print(f"You have {year_to_days} days, {year_to_weeks} weeks, and {year_to_months} months left.")

# Alternatively, you can code as following below:

age = input("What is your current age?")

age_as_int = int(age)

years_remaining = 90 - age_as_int

year_to_days = years_remaining  * 365

year_to_weeks = years_remianing * 52

year_to_months = years_remianing * 12

print(f"You have {year_to_days} days, {year_to_weeks} weeks, and {year_to_months} months left."
